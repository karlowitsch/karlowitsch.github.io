                        More recently, critics and scholars have defended Watership Down's potential value for child audiences. Children's media scholar Catherine Lester argues that the violence is "never without a specific
                        narrative or moral purpose" and that discussions of the film's effect upon children require "greater nuance" that acknowledges the complexity and variety of children as viewers and how they respond to
                        films.[37] Gerard Jones, in his essay for The Criterion Collection, admits that the film "has troubled me ever since I first saw it" at the age of twenty-one, but that he believes it is an important film
                        for viewers of all ages because it "asks us to spend time with those elements of existence that we will always find most troubling (and haunting and moving), and that we so rarely allow our children's
                        culture or our own entertainment to dwell on." He cites as an example the non-violent death of Hazel from old age at the end of the film, which he calls "as joyous as it is poignant".[38]

                <p> Watership Down has developed a reputation as a distressing children's text, with Ed Power of The Independent describing the film in a
                    40th anniversary retrospective as a "classic" but which "arguably traumatised an entire generation".[30] In 2016, British broadcaster Channel 5 faced criticism after broadcasting the film in a
                    pre-watershed slot on Easter Sunday, which was seen to be in poor taste due to the film's representations of violence inflicted upon rabbits, and with many on social media expressing concern about
                    child viewers being distressed (though it is unclear whether any children were actually negatively affected).[31] Despite the criticism, Channel 5 broadcast Watership Down on Easter Sunday again the
                    following year.[32] Despite the film's reputation as traumatising, initial regulators and critics expressed little concern about the potentially negative effects on children. When first submitted
                    to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), it passed with a U (universal, suitable for all) classification, deciding that "Animation removes the realistic gory horror in the occasional
                    scenes of violence and bloodshed, and we felt that, while the film may move children emotionally during the film's duration, it could not seriously trouble them once the spell of the story is broken,
                    and that a 'U' certificate was therefore quite appropriate."[33] This choice has proven controversial, and in 2012, the BBFC acknowledged that it had "received complaints about the suitability of
                    Watership Down at 'U' almost every year since its classification".[34] In August 2022, the BBFC raised the classification to PG for "mild violence, threat, brief bloody images, language".[35]
                    Like the BBFC, critics during initial release characterised Watership Down as suitable for children in spite of its potentially distressing aspects. The Spectator's Ted Whitehead described it as "a
                    straightforward children's adventure story".[36] Scott in The Globe and Mail wrote that "Parents are more apt to feel squeamish about this than their children: there is nothing as devastating as the
                    death of Bambi's mother. In Watership Down, some of the rabbits are unlucky and some live to old age. When they do die, the deaths are treated with sympathy but not morbidity. The message is that life
                    is hard, and difficult, but that it's fun, and rewarding, too."[23] Malcolm in The Guardian dismissed concerns about the film's suitability for children by stating that "It is not true, as had already
                    been hinted at by some, that the film is too violent and disturbing for children. What, pray, about some of Grimms' fairy tales?"[26] Fox in Films and Filming was one of the few critics to express caution
                    by saying that, because of the "graphic horror", "one could scarcely recommend the film to the very young".[25]
                    More recently, critics and scholars have defended Watership Down's potential value for child audiences. Children's media scholar Catherine Lester argues that the violence is "never without a specific
                    narrative or moral purpose" and that discussions of the film's effect upon children require "greater nuance" that acknowledges the complexity and variety of children as viewers and how they respond to
