                    fiction novel and cautionary tale by English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8
                    June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime.
                    Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive
                    regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist,
                    modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4]
                    More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways 
                    in which they can be manipulated.

                        independent thinking.[5]

                    <p class="runner">It also popularised the term "Orwellian" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering 
                        common usage, including "Big Brother", "doublethink", "Thought Police", "thoughtcrime", "Newspeak", and "2 + 2 = 5". 
                        Parallels have been drawn between the novel's subject matter and real life instances of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, 
                        and violations of freedom of expression among other themes.[6][7][8] Orwell described his book as a "satire",[9] and a 
                        display of the "perversions to which a centralised economy is liable," while also stating he believed "that something 
                        resembling it could arrive."[9] Time included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 
                        2005,[10] and it was placed on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels list, reaching number 13 on the editors' list and number 
                        6 on the readers' list.[11] In 2003, it was listed at number eight on The Big Read survey by the BBC.[12]
